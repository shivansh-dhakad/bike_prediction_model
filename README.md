# bike_prediction_model

This is a simple Machine Learning + Web App project I built while learning Machine Learning.
The goal of this project is to predict the resale price of a bike based on different details like:
- Brand

- Owner type

- Engine power (cc)

- Year of purchase

- Kilometers driven

- Original price

It’s a beginner-friendly project that connects an ML model with a website using Flask.


🌟 What This Project Does

- Takes user input through a clean web interface

- Sends the data to a Flask backend

- Uses a trained ML model to predict the bike price

- Shows the predicted price on the webpage

🧰 Technologies Used

- Python

- Flask

- Machine Learning (scikit-learn)

- Pandas / NumPy

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Joblib for saving the model

🎓 What I Learned

Building this project helped me understand:

- How to train a machine learning model

- How to preprocess data (like encoding text into numbers)

- How to save and load models

- How to create a simple API using Flask

- How to connect frontend and backend

- How ML can be used in real applications

This was a great hands-on project for learning ML fundamentals.

🙌 Final Thoughts

This project helped me understand the complete process of building a machine learning model and using it inside a real web application.
I will be improving this further as I continue learning ML and web development!
